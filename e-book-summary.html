# 5 key concepts regarding risk and controls

* "Risk, broadly defined, means uncertainty. In a business context risk equates to "uncertainty of outcome". If a company knew for certain what was going to happen in the future there would be no risk, but of course this is not possible. Consequently, risk must be managed."

* "Risk should be optimised, rather than minimised. That is to say, every business should be looking to optimise the amount of risk it is prepared to accept in the pursuit of value, with the crucial reference point always being the risk appetite of each individual business."

* "Risk is dynamic, it changes all the time. Internal controls are not dynamic, however. In many organisations, especially mature businesses, control systems and procedures have evolved slowly over time and may be characterised as being essentially historic, as remaining "anchored in the past". As a result, gaps often appear between risks (which are changing) and controls (which are slow to react to those changes)."

---

# 5 key concepts regarding risk and controls

* "Risk determines controls, not the other way around.Internal controls exist for many reasons but fundamentally they are there to help to manage risk. It is simply not possible, therefore, for any organisation to have an effective and efficient system of internal controls in place unless it is based on a thorough, systematic and ongoing assessment of risk in the business."

* "Understand the essence of the control concept. Key aspects of controls need to be understood also, in addition to the ideas on risk. Here, there are two crucial questions about control effectiveness. ...The first key question is: "are the controls effectively designed?" The second key question is: "are the controls working effectively, in accordance with the control design?" "

* Detection

* Risk-based approach

---

# 5 best practice guide for managing fraud risk

* Principle 1

&gt; "A fraud risk management programme should be in place, as part of the organisation's governance structure. This will include a written policy stating the expectations of the board of directors and
senior management regarding managing fraud risk."

* Principle 2

&gt; "There should be an assessment of fraud risk carried out by the organisation periodically to identify specific threats and changes to the risk profile that need to be controlled and mitigated."

---

# 5 best practice guide for managing fraud risk

* Principle 3

&gt; "The organisation should have prevention controls and techniques in place to avoid potential key fraud risk events."

* Principle 4

&gt; "The organisation should have detective controls and techniques available to uncover fraud events when preventative measures fail or unmitigated risks are realised."

* Principle 5

&gt;  "A reporting process should be in place, together with a coordinated approach to investigation and corrective action. This should help ensure that potential fraud is dealt with in an appropriate and
timely manner."

---

# Fraud risk management framework

* Investigation (Chapter 9): "fraud events need to be investigated thoroughly and professionally"

* Prevention and deterrence (Chapter 7): "policies, controls, training and communication that organisations use to try to stop fraud from occurring"

* Detection (Chapter 8): "detective controls to reduce the exposure gap - the length of time from when a fraud starts to when the victim organisation finds out about it"

* Risk-based approach

# Chapter 4: Risk

---

# Risk management related definitions

* Risk management

&gt; "Risk management is a process to identify, assess, manage and control potential events or situations, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the organisation's objectives."

* Risk

&gt; "the best starting point in terms of a discussion on risk, is provided by the phrase "uncertainty of outcome". In an uncertain world, two things can happen: there are indeed a huge number of threats, things that can go wrong in both our personal and our business lives; but there are also opportunities. Modern risk management is about managing both sides of this "risk tree" so that organisations can deal effectively with potential future events that create uncertainty."

---

# Risk management related definitions

* Risk management cycle

&gt; "a broad five-stage risk management cycle: the strategy for managing risk is set by the board; there are then distinct processes both to identify and to prioritise risk; the existing controls and monitoring procedures are then assessed; and finally there must be a process to measure the residual risk position and to monitor progress going forward. The whole process should be dynamic and ongoing" (Diagram 4.1)

---

# 4Ts Approach

* "The "4Ts" approach proposes that every risk exposure in an organisation can be managed according to one of four alternative methods"

  + "Tolerate - accept the risk"

  + "Transfer - let someone else take part of the risk"

  + "Terminate -eliminate the risk"

  + "Treat - take cost-effective in-house actions to reduce the risk"

---

# Taking a risk-based approach to fraud

* Fraud risk profile:

&gt; "A fraud risk profile ... should periodically assess and prioritise the risk that fraud poses to its business formally and methodically."

&gt; "fraud risk profile ...should be entirely consistent in terms of template and methodology with ...a formalised, documented system, showing clearly how risk is identified, assessed, controlled and monitored"

* Fraud as high probability, low impact risk

&gt; "There are a whole series of specific fraud threats to an organisation that do not in themselves represent high impact risk but where the overall effect is likely to be corrosive. Examples are: submitting false invoices, fiddling expense claims, skimming cash, adding ghost employees to the payroll. "

---

# Taking a risk-based approach to fraud

* Fraud as low probability, high impact risk

&gt; "owners, senior managers or individuals in charge of high spending departments commit fraud that seriously damages the organisation ...under two headings: fraudulent financial statements and corruption. "

# Chapter 5: Governance

---

# Example of failure of corporate governance

* Enron, at page 122.

---

# Agency risk and role of independent non-executive directors

&gt; "Shareholders appoint professionals to manage their business for them ...these managers work full-time in the business and are effectively the agents of the shareholders."

* Old-fashioned model

&gt; "Shareholders provide capital to management who report to the shareholders." (Diagram 5.1)

---

# Agency risk and role of independent non-executive directors

* Modern balanced model

&gt; "power is shared much more equally between executive and non-executive directors. Directors are accountable to their shareholders. It is the directors, especially the independent non-executive directors, who act as the fulcrum in the continuing relationship between shareholders and managers, so that there is greater assurance that the executives are always promoting the interests of the shareholders. In other words, it is the importance and responsibilities now given to the independent non-executive directors that enable agency risk to be managed with reasonable assurance." (Diagram 5.2)

---

# Development of corporate governance

* Rules-based governance regime

&gt; "Some governance systems are based firmly on the law. That is to say, compliance with the system is underpinned by legislation. Codes with legal enforceability are rules and so these are known as "rules-based" regimes." (e.g. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002)

* Principles-based governance regime

&gt; "Others are based on governance codes of best practice where compliance is voluntary rather than a legal requirement. These are known as "principles-based" regimes." (e.g. UK Financial Reporting Council, The UK Corporate Governance Code (Final Draft) April 2016)

# Chapter 6: Controls

---

# Two fundamental questions regarding assessing controls

1. "First, is the control effectively designed?"

1. "Secondly, is the control working efficiently?"

---

# 5 Control characteristics

1. Preventive controls

1. Detective controls

1. Manual controls

1. Automated controls

1. Hard controls

1. Soft controls

---

# Control characteristics

* Preventive controls

&gt; "The aim of a preventative control is to stop an event from occurring or a risk from materialising in the first place."

* Detective controls

&gt; "Highlight or flag up or otherwise indicate to management that something has gone wrong - that is to say, when a risk, a problem or a fault in the system has occurred."

* Manual controls

&gt; "A manual control exists where somebody (an individual) has actually got to do something, where he or she becomes physically involved in the process."

---

# Control characteristics

* Automated controls

&gt; "Automated controls are generally considered to be more efficient and cost-effective than manual controls."

* Hard controls

&gt; "Documented policies, procedures and systems notes; Approvals and signatures; Reconciliations; Segregation of duties; and Physical controls."

* Soft controls

&gt; "Organisational culture and values; Business ethics; Employee support programmes; Training and development; and Accountability and management oversight."


---

# 3 areas assessing effectiveness of internal controls

* "First, what is the commitment of the organisation to competence, to training and developing its people? Do the managers and employees have the appropriate skills and training to do their jobs well?"

* "Secondly, what is the quality of supervision like throughout the organisation? To what extent are the departmental heads, team leaders and line managers able to manage, motivate and control their people?"

* "Thirdly, to what extent is the organisation committed to managing the behaviours of its employees so that they match the values of the business? Is the importance of always acting in accordance with the code of conduct and/or the ethics charter made clear to everyone who works in the organisation?"

---

# Limitations of traditional audit techniques

* Poor understanding of fraud risk

&gt; "Opportunity is certainly examined through audit review, analysis and testing of internal controls. However, in most audits the possible motives of fraudsters are simply not focused on at all. This is a serious weakness and it means that behavioural "red flags" and other warning signs that might point to the existence of fraud will often be missed as a result."

* Audit testing based on small sample sizes

---

# Examples of poor performance by audit committees

* Hollinger International, at page 203

* Enron, at page 204

* Satyam fraud, at page 165

# Chapter 7: Prevention

---

# Introduction

&gt; "First, we look at the broad framework, the generic controls such as segregation of duties that provide the essential foundations for an effective fraud risk management strategy."

&gt; "Then we focus specifically on those controls that are designed with the purpose of preventing fraud from occurring. There is in fact a "menu" of such controls. It is important that directors and managers are aware of the menu so that they can select from it the most appropriate controls for their own particular situation."

---

# Generic controls

* Segregation of duties

&gt; "traditionally means the separation in each business process of the following responsibilities: custody of assets; record keeping; authorisation; and reconciliation. Ideally, no one person should handle more than one of these responsibilities in a business process."

* Segregation at the top too

* Personal fiefdoms

&gt; "a situation where a certain individual has attained such a position of power, influence and autonomy in a business unit, or a subsidiary company or a division, either through outstanding results or through force of personality (or a combination of the two), that he or she is able to do pretty well as they please without being subject to even routine checking. ...the activities of Mr Leeson during his time as general manager in the small Singapore office of Barings Bank in 1992 - 95."
---

# Generic controls

* Delegations of authority and authorisation limits

&gt; "State clearly the maximum authority levels for each level of the organisation's hierarchy for budgeted and unbudgeted expenditure."

* Physical &amp; computer security over assets, records and informations

---

# Control inhibitors and concealment strategies

* Management override of controls

* Collusion

* Processing a transaction below the control radar

* False documentation

* Block the flow of information

&gt; "Long delays in receiving promised information are among the most frustrating realities of the business world with which an auditor has to deal. ...The long delay might be caused by the fact that the individual who is responsible for producing the requested information does not want to release it because he or she has something to hide."

---

# 6 specific anti-fraud prevention controls

* Hard prevention control

	+ Staff vetting procedures;
	
	+ job rotation and mandatory vacations;
	
	+ anti-fraud policy statement

* Soft prevention control

	+ Employee support programmes;
	
	+ fraud awareness training programmes;
	
	+ management review of internal controls.

---

# Staff vetting

* Identification documents

* Verification of academic qualifications

* Verification of professional qualifications or memberships

* Employment reference checks

* Checking international criminal records

* Credit reference searches

---

# Job rotation and mandatory vacations

* Job rotation

&gt; "There are a number of risks associated with allowing employees to remain in the same job year after year: boredom and disillusionment can set in; the employee becomes demotivated and less efficient over time; and/or the employee, either working alone or in collusion with colleagues (especially when he or she is part of a small self-contained team, for example in a traditional cashiers office), is tempted to engage in fraud or some other counter productive work behaviours."

* Mandatory vacations

&gt; "From the fraud risk management perspective, mandatory vacations are a form of short-term job rotation in that the employee is away from his or her main area of work for the period of the holiday. While the employee is on vacation, it is more likely that any illegal activity, if it is taking place, will be detected."

---

# Anti-fraud policy statement

* Elements of the anti-fraud policy

&gt; "define fraud; give pointers to staff in terms of what to look for; emphasise the importance of an anti-fraud culture; set out responsibilities, including the individual or department with overall responsibility for overseeing the policy; establish reporting lines; and act as a deterrent by setting out the consequences of engaging in fraud."

* Response plan (document itself)

&gt; "The fraud response plan is an outline of the process that will be followed in the event of a fraud being suspected or discovered."

---

# Anti-fraud policy statement

* Communicating the policy

&gt; "all those affected by the anti-fraud policy, all staff and relevant third parties, are aware of it and of what it says."

* Zero tolerance concept

&gt; "eliminating undesirable conduct by the strict application of sanctions when a law or rule is broken."

---

# Employee support programmes

* Often called employee assistance programmes ("EAPs")

&gt; "these programmes aim to help workers by means of confidential counselling in areas such as: drug and alcohol rehabilitation, gambling addiction, abusive households, marital problems, mental health issues, financial difficulties and stress."

---

# Fraud awareness training programmes

* "Always include an element of fraud awareness in the induction process for new staff"

* "Utilise the internal auditors as consultants to deliver cost-effective in-house training"

* "Make use of fraud quizzes and practical examples (events that have happened within the organisation if appropriate) to make the training as interesting and relevant as possible"

* "Where there is a requirement to train staff for compliance purposes (for example, in anti-money laundering or the Bribery Act 2010), broaden the scope of the subject matter to include fraud risk also"

* "Consider using alternative and/or complementary techniques to raise awareness of fraud (e.g. computer based training)"

---

# Management review of internal controls

* "Some form of structured management review of internal controls is a central part of the modern governance, risk management and controls agenda ...the review of internal controls should extend down to line manager and team leader level ...management needs to be especially proactive in its review and oversight of the operations in smaller businesses."

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Chapter 8: Detection

---

# Introduction

* Deterrence

&gt; "Deterrence means the modification of behaviour by the threat of sanctions. A key concept of fraud deterrence is "the perception of detection". According to this concept, an individual who is considering committing fraud will be unlikely to proceed to the act if he or she believes that the consequences will be that they are caught, prosecuted and jailed."

---

# Introduction

* Detecton

&gt; "Generic and preventative controls: reconciliations, independent reviews, physical inspections and stock counts, variance analyses and audit. ...surprise audits; whistle-blowing hotlines and the use of data mining software."

---

# Deterrence factor

* What is meant by deterrence

&gt; "If the consequences of committing a crime are thought to outweigh the benefit of the crime itself, then the individual concerned will be deterred from going ahead and actually committing the crime. This is very much aligned to Dr Cressey's research and to the thinking behind the Fraud Triangle model ...an individual's willingness to commit fraud is inversely proportional to the perceived risk of being caught."

---

# Deterrence factor

* Perception of detection

&gt; "...those who think that they will be caught if they commit fraud are less likely to go ahead and commit the crime. One issue that organisations need to address is whether or not they are going to inform the authorities about an internal fraud. ...If the employees know that the police will be contacted in the event of any fraud, however, then there are real benefits to the organisation in terms of increased fraud deterrence. Also, in practice, fears of reputational damage are often unfounded. In fact the situation can often be turned to the organisation's advantage in terms of taking a robust approach that protects shareholders and stakeholders interests alike"

---

# Deterrence factor

* Ways to increase deterrence factor

	+ Surprise audits

	+ Asking about fraud as part of routine audit enquiries

	+ Surveillance and monitoring

	+ Enforcement of policies

	+ Prosecute fraudsters and publicise successful convictions

---

# 3 key fraud detective measures

* Surprise audits

&gt; "The purpose of surprise audits in a compliance context is to ensure that the auditor sees the records and performance of the entity "live" so to speak, or as they would be under normal operating conditions, and not as they appear to be following an intensive clean-up campaign in the days immediately before the visit to make sure that every- thing looks good during the inspection."

---

# 3 key fraud detective measures

* Whistle-blowing hotlines

&gt; "Whistle-blowing is to be differentiated from a complaint or a grievance, where the employee making the report is directly and personally affected and is seeking redress or justice for himself or herself from any resulting investigation."

&gt; "All organisations seeking to have an effective whistle-blowing mechanism in place must emphasise that anyone who reports incidents in good faith under the policy will be protected from dismissal or any form of disciplinary action, retaliation or victimisation. ...In addition to receiving copies of the policy, employees should learn about the hotline as part of their initial induction training programme, ...It is a fundamental point that if the whistle-blowing hotline is to remain credible, all disclosures are followed up and are properly investigated. ...The over-arching point is that all organisations should be committed to investigating disclosures fully, fairly, quickly and confidentially."

---

# 3 key fraud detective measures

* Data mining and data analysis techniques

&gt; "Use of data mining software will enable management to: identify hidden relationships among people, organisations and events; identify suspicious transactions; spot and correct errors; assess the effectiveness of internal controls; monitor fraud threats and vulnerabilities; and not least consider and analyse thousands or even millions of transactions."

&gt; "It is fundamental that the search criteria for a data mining exercise are compiled according to risk. This means that the auditor (or manager) must program the software to look for signs of fraud, often described as red flags."

# Chapter 9 Investigation

---

# Chapter Title: Investigation

* Introduction

&gt; "In the first section I set out in full a narrative of the events of the fraud investigation case ...In the second part of the Chapter we then analyse the key ground rules of fraud investigations from a general and best practice perspective and look at some other real life examples from the interviews with business directors and managers that I conducted for the purposes of this book."

---

# Fraud investigation case study

* Project Fuschia - a case study at page 257

---

# Summary of most important areas of a fraud investigation

* Step 1

&gt; "Assess the credibility of the underlying allegations quickly and confidentially."

* Step 2

&gt; "If the initial suspicion is confirmed, suspend the suspect and escort him or her from the premises."

* Step 3

&gt; "Set the objectives of the investigation - in particular, what is the desired end-game? Obtain expert legal advice."

* Step 4

&gt; "Obtain expert legal advice"

---

# Summary of most important areas of a fraud investigation

* Step 5

&gt; "Pull together all the available evidence through an analysis of documentation, a review of external sources and a programme of interviews."

* Step 6

&gt; "Interview the suspect at the end of the evidence-gathering process"

* Step 7

&gt; "If no confession is obtained from the suspect during this last interview, assess with lawyers and insurers whether the evidence obtained is sufficient for civil and/or criminal litigation purposes."

---

# Fraud investigation - best practices

* Handling the initial allegations

	+ Objectives: "resolve allegations efficiently, thoroughly and fairly"
	
	+ Confidentiality
	
	+ Speed: "the need for some part at least of the allegation to be verified by available evidence"
	
	+ Initial suspicious confirmed: "subject of allegations should be suspended immediately on full pay and removed from organisation for an agreed period of time after which they will be required to attend an interview"

* Setting overall objectives

	+ "Strategy versus tactics: it is the long-term, strategic view of the case that is always fundamental to its success or failure"
	
	+ "The importance of the end game: how they want the investigation to turn out (various objectives of a fraud investigation)"

---

# Fraud investigation - best practices

* Reporting lines and investigation team

	+ "Governance structure: clear reporting lines in place to deal with fraud events and a member of the board should take responsibility fo financial risk management."

	+ "Composition of the team: The size of the team that conducts the day-to-day investigation work will vary according to the scale, nature and complexity of the underlying fraud."

	+ "Forensic accountants: commission an investigation in these circumstances that is truly independent, which means appointing a firm other than the auditors to carry it out."

---

# Fraud investigation - best practices

* Communication issues

	+ "Media contingency planning: The golden rule here is that there should be only one point of contact internally with the media."

	+ "Managing internal communications: The first is what to do when the investigation process first becomes public knowledge within the organisation. This is likely to happen as soon as the suspect is suspended, escorted from the premises and told not to return or have any contact with the organisation for a period of time."

# Key Learning Points

---

# Introduction

* At the end of each chapter, Steve Giles listed out key learning points for directors and managers.

* They are reproduced in the subsequent slides / handout.

---

class: inverse, center, middle


# Chapter 1: Responsibility

---

# Responsibility

&gt; "Remember the Responsibility Framework and the associated triangle diagram. All risks and controls can be fitted into this framework. Ultimate responsibility for managing risk resides with the board and senior managers. This is devolved to departmental heads and line managers who become effectively the point men and women in your organisation in relation to risk and controls. To make the whole thing work, the framework is underpinned by everyone being aware of personal responsibility for risk and controls when carrying out their work."

&gt; "Carry out regular fraud risk assessment (or risk profiling) exercises. Risk must be assessed and prioritised if it is to be managed effectively. Without assessing risk it will be impossible to design proportionate controls to manage your fraud threats effectively."

---

# Responsibility

&gt; "Make sure that everything done to manage fraud risk is evidence-based.This means that the fraud risk assessment must be documented and also that all policies, procedures, training programmes etc. must exist and be updated regularly."

&gt; "Do not over-rely on traditional audit techniques for fraud prevention and detection. Be realistic in terms of the focus of external audit work and try to improve internal audit capabilities through a combination of recruiting experts and investing in training programmes and / or modern detective tools."

&gt; "Take a strategic approach to the problem. Commit to a fraud risk management programme, be proactive and focus resources on the areas of prevention and deter- rence. Have appropriate detective measures in place to reduce the exposure gap to a minimum and have access to investigation expertise, either external or in-house, to give assurance that potential future fraud events will be dealt with in an appropriate and timely manner."


---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Chapter 2

---

# Meaning of Fraud

&gt; "Use the definition of fraud in the auditing standards as a reference point. Be aware in particular of the most important parts of the definition: fraud is an intentional act (so distinguishing it from an error or a mistake) involving the use of deception to gain an illicit advantage (so it is a hidden scheme and is often therefore very difficult to detect)."

&gt; "Remember that there are three components of occupational fraud: fraudulent financial statements; asset misappropriation; and corruption. Most people think of fraud in terms of one or more of the asset misappropriation schemes only and this is a mistake."

&gt; "Use the ACFE's website as a key resource for information on and analysis of fraud. Also, consider making the most of the work of the ACFE either by taking out corporate membership for your organisation or by recruiting a Certified Fraud Examiner to join your internal audit team (or another suitable department), thereby increasing the capability of your business to deal with internal fraud threats."

---

# Meaning of Fraud

&gt; "Understand that fraud is a real cost to your business, both in terms of financial loss and also of collateral damage. Studies show that organisations lose on average somewhere between 2-5%, perhaps more, of their turnover each year to internal fraud. However, the potential damage is not only financial as it can result in significant reputational damage and can also torpedo morale amongst employees inside the organisation."

&gt; "An economic downturn brings an increased risk of fraud. Don't simply ignore it. Instead, make a commitment to using modern, smart, targeted controls to provide your business with reasonable assurance around the prevention and detection of occupational fraud."

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Chapter 3: People

---

# People

&gt; "Be aware of the two overarching principles of internal fraud, so far as managing the "people risk" component of it is concerned. First, the three legs of the Fraud Triangle are present in every fraud case: motive, opportunity and rationalisation. Secondly, the biggest risk in any organisation in terms of losses from fraud lies at the top with the owners, directors and executives."

&gt; "Recognise that there are two aspects to the opportunity factor. First, the fraudster must work in a suitable position or role within an organisation that will mean that it is possible for him or her to carry out the prospective fraud. The keys to this are authority and/or autonomy. Secondly, the perpetrator must also believe that they can conceal the fraud successfully in order to avoid detection."

---

# People

&gt; "Commit to establishing a strong control framework. Most fraudsters are first-time offenders. This means that any individual who might be thinking of committing fraud in the future is likely never to have been convicted of a crime in the past. Therefore he or she is also likely to be very fearful of the prospect of being caught, convicted and sent to prison as a result of committing fraud. A strong control framework will always serve as a particularly powerful deterrent in this situation because it will increase the perception in the mind of the prospective fraudster that any crime committed in the organisation will be detected and that the perpetrator will go to prison as a result."

# People

&gt; "Recognise that as a result of the difficult economic conditions in the US, Europe and elsewhere around the world, fraud risk has increased significantly in most public and private sector organisations. Look to install smarter controls. Targeted anti-fraud controls, linked to a good understanding of fraud risk, provide the most effective solution for directors and managers."

# Chapter 4: Risk

# Risk

&gt; "Remember that fraud risk is linked to positions of seniority and power in an organisation. Although it might seem counter-intuitive, the owners, directors and senior managers of a business represent the greatest fraud risks in that business."

&gt; "Adopt a twin-track approach, depending on the type of fraud risk: financial statement fraud and corruption issues are low probability, high impact risks and demand a strategy of avoidance; asset misappropriation schemes on the other hand represent high probability, low impact risks and should be managed using proportionate controls to contain threats to acceptable levels."

&gt; "Ensure that your insurance strategy is adequate and appropriate not only in terms of providing cover against potential losses from fraud but also that it is consistent with the overall business strategy of your organisation."

---

# Risk

&gt; "Understand the importance of a documented process for managing risk in the 21st century. If your organisation does not have such a process, make a commitment to spend the necessary money and time to install a risk management system that is proportionate to your individual business needs as soon as possible - your auditors should be able to help with this."

&gt; "Make sure that a specific fraud risk assessment is prepared, documented and regularly updated. If possible, expand this to include any other areas of financial crime that are relevant to your business, so that the most powerful, holistic approach is taken to managing financial crime risks."

# Chapter 5: Governance

---

# Governance

&gt; "Remember always that the prime duty of a director is to the company itself - not to the shareholders and certainly not to the stakeholders. This is a legal obligation and stems from the fact that a limited liability company is a separate legal entity."

&gt; "Put in place a formal review of the effectiveness of governance processes every year.This should comprise two elements: a self-assessment by the board of its own performance combined with an independent review to be carried out by either an internal function (ideally by internal audit) or by an external third party."

&gt; "Ensure that there are strong controls in place surrounding the financial reporting process. The SOX has been the driver of an extremely robust control framework over financial reporting for companies listed in the US. But the many examples of accounting fraud carried out by directors and senior managers clearly show that no organisation can afford to be complacent in this area."

---

# Governance

&gt; "Encourage debate, scrutiny and challenge around the boardroom table. It is vital, both for good business performance and for the effective management of risk (including fraud risk) that the directors operate as a high-performing team. Avoid the four bad habits of poor performing boards: passivity; cronyism; bullying; and ignorance."

&gt; "Be aware of the increased risks attached to bribery and corruption in the private sector as a result of new legislation and convention, underpinned by robust action by the authorities. Commit to a zero tolerance approach and make sure that adequate procedures are in place to prevent bribery anywhere in your business operations."

# Chapter 6: Controls

---

# Controls

&gt; "Make the commitment to create a transparent, controls-conscious organisation. This will require both money and resources but also, if it is to succeed, the emotional investment of those at the top."

&gt; "Always be vigilant and aware of what is happening in the workplace and of the customs and practices that may have built up over time. If this includes conduct that is inappropriate and/or detrimental to the success of the organisation, then take steps to stop the practices concerned and change the behaviour of employees."

&gt; "Make sure that controls are designed and updated so that they remain proportionate to the changing risks in the business. Also, have monitoring and review systems in place to confirm that the controls are actually operating in accordance with how they were designed."

---

# Controls

&gt; "Be aware of the five control frameworks developed in the last 20 years. Choose to adopt the one that is most appropriate to the needs of your business or, in the case of small or medium-sized businesses, the parts of one of the frameworks that can be taken up with benefit by the business."

&gt; "Do not place undue reliance on traditional audits to prevent and detect fraud. Instead be aware of the more proactive approach required by the new auditing standards. Make sure that the external auditors are complying with these requirements and consider incorporating this new approach into the internal audit charter also. Ensure that the audit committee is both competent and independent but also that it is well led, proactive and is prepared to scrutinise and challenge the actions of executives when required."

# Chapter 7: Prevention

---

# Prevention

&gt; "Be aware of the importance of the six key fraud prevention controls: staff vetting; employee support programmes; job rotation and mandatory vacations; fraud awareness training; an anti-fraud policy statement; and management review of internal controls."

&gt; "Understand the importance of the three key generic controls that provide the foundation for the anti-fraud framework. These are: segregation of duties; delegation of authority levels and authorisation limits; and physical and computer security over assets, records and information."

&gt; "Always carry out a cost/benefit analysis - some controls are more appropriate in certain organisations that in others. For example, segregation of duties is a vital part of the controls framework of larger organisations but may well be impractical in many small or medium-sized companies. For smaller organisations, a visible and proactive review by management of the business in general, and the operation of anti-fraud controls in particular, will be essential to provide assurance."

---

# Prevention

&gt; "Consider adopting the 5-Point Fraud Prevention Plan as a proportionate and cost- effective way of increasing assurance in your business."

&gt; "Remember that there is no such thing as a system of controls that is guaranteed to be fraud-proof. Because of this, there is always a need to combine preventative controls with detective controls for an optimal anti-fraud framework."

# Chapter 8

---

# Detection

&gt; "Understand the importance of the perception of detection concept and be prepared to take tough decisions to increase it. Make sure that controls are robust and are enforced so that those who are thinking about committing fraud will be deterred from actually doing so by the prospect of being caught, being prosecuted and going to jail."

&gt; "A whistle-blowing hotline is a very important detective control for fraud, bribery and other corrupt business practices. Carefully assess whether it is appropriate to your organisation. If it is, ensure not only that this control is in place in your organisation but also that it is working effectively too. This will require a periodic, independent review (by internal audit or others) of the whistle-blowing process."

---

# Detection

&gt; "Encourage the internal audit function to include provision for a small number of surprise audits in its audit plan each year. Support the auditors when these happen as they may well not be popular in the operational and service units affected. However, surprise audits are an effective tool in the fight against fraud. Make sure they are not overlooked in your organisation."


&gt; "Commit to the use of data mining software by auditors and/or management."


&gt; "Be aware of two practical fraud risk measures: the importance of break-point clustering as a simple but effective fraud detection technique and the need to monitor the activities of outliers. Many fraudsters attempt to abuse financial authority limits by processing transactions just below an authorisation threshold. So, whether by making use of data mining software or by manual review, ensure that regular checks in these areas are carried out. Any individual or department that produces truly exceptional results (either good or bad) should be highlighted for review by management to confirm the numbers and understand what the causes are."

# Chapter 9

# Investigation

&gt; "Assume always that a fraud investigation will end up in court. Be prepared for this and adopt a forensic approach to the investigation throughout."


&gt; "Ensure that your organisation has access to fraud investigation expertise either internally (through the appropriate training of existing staff or by recruiting an anti-fraud specialist) or externally (by using forensic accountants and/or specialist investigators)."


&gt; "Always use specialists when conducting covert investigations. Make sure that their activities are closely supervised, both from the cost point of view and also to ensure that they comply with the law. Evidence obtained illegally will not be allowed to be used in court and the organisation might incur reputational damage if it is seen to have engaged in illegal activities."

---

# Investigation

&gt; "Focus on the end-game. Set clear objectives for the investigation which should always be directed towards the best interests of the organisation. Understand the differences between civil and criminal litigation and do not allow personal emotions to interfere with a professional and objective assessment of the merits of the case."


&gt; "Be clear on where the recovery of losses will come from. This is normally from one or more of: the defendants, the auditors or the insurers. Be realistic about the extent of the recoverable assets of the defendants and the chances of a successful action against the auditors. Make sure the insurers are kept fully informed throughout the investigation process as they often hold the key to recoveries."

# Distinguished merit

&gt; "I am standing in the small and beautiful Trafalgar Cemetery just outside the old city walls. ...I walk over to stand in front of one of the two gravestones in the cemetery ...here are buried two casualties of the Battle of Trafalgar, Admiral Nelson's famous naval victory over the combined French and Spanish fleets in October 1805. The inscription on this tombstone reads as follows:"

&gt;&gt; "To the memory of Captain Thomas Norman of the Royal Marine Corps ...His brother officers ...sincere testimony of their sense of his distinguished merit ...."

&gt; "I have never heard of Captain Thomas Norman before, he is not famous like Nelson. The phrase "their sense of his distinguished merit" is striking, however, it makes an impression on me. Captain Norman was an ordinary sailor not a hero and, as a naval officer, his rank indicates that he would have achieved no more than moderate success."

---

# Distinguished merit

&gt; "There are many other words that I could use to describe these individuals in the book, some of them much more loaded with meaning and judgement. I think through a list of alternative words and phrases: thief, cheat, liar, crook, imposter, con-artist, hoaxer, swindler, fake, grifter, phoney, confidence-trickster, scammer, illusionist, snake-oil salesman, mountebank, deceiver, bilk, forger, rip-off merchant."

---

# Distinguished merit

&gt; "I have a clear idea already of the core group of individual fraudsters that I will be naming in the book. They are directors and executives mostly, with a number of traders from the banking sector included for obvious reasons. When they are listed together they make a somewhat motley crew: Leeson, Lay, Skilling, Fastow, Ebbers, Sullivan, Rusnak, Black, Tanzi, Tonna, Kerviel, Bennett, Rajaratnam, Raju and Madoff. All of them have become infamous because of their involvement in corporate fraud. What else do they all have in common? Well, most obviously they are all men. Greed is a second clear group characteristic, arrogance no doubt a third. However, there is another similarity, not so frequently commented on but every bit as important in my view. This is a group that is entirely lacking in any sense of "distinguished merit"."
